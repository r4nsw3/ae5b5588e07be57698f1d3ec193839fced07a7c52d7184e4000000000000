   <--( Game Info )----------------------------------------------- ----- -->
    
    Unique fusion of a top down shooter and tower defense strategy. You 
    are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its
    resources and terraform the surface.
    Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of
    alien towers or throw yourself right into heat of the battle.
    Build mazes for incoming enemies, tear down buildings and collapse 
    bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of
    unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and
    use defense strategies like you’ve never seen before in this genre.
   
    Features:
    - X-Morph Defense - Complete edition includes the base game and its
      3 DLC (European Assault, Survival of the Fittest and Last Bastion).
    - Your goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming
      human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which
      the player can check what types of enemies are going to be 
      attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit 
      for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or 
      choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed 
      during the battle.
    - The games environments are constructed with a lot of attention to
      detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small 
      picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the 
      game can be collapsed and it’s destruction is dynamically simulated
      using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual 
      effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the 
      battlefield.
